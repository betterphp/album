# Album

A photo album manager that does what I want it to. Very much a work in progress.

## Development

Install or update any node dependencies
```
yarn install
```

Start the dev environment
```
yarn start:dev
```

If you prefer you can also run the react and electron dev servers in separate terminals
```
yarn start:dev-server
yarn start:electron
```

On Linux you need to install libsecret for [keytar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keytar) to work
```
sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev
```
